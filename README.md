# ice-maze
Game developed in C++ with OpenGL. It helped me understand how graphic libraries (OpenGL) work along with window libraries (SDL2). It contains basic physics and control. Only 1 level. I scraped this project and moved on to developing my own game engine.

# Installation
This is a Visual Studio projects, just open it and click run. OpenGL packages are included.

# Features
- Load and save map
- Game Physics
- Old fashioned drawing (drawing every frame)

# TODO
- So many that I don't want to list them, I just started a new project that uses DirectX.
